# Tailwind Skill

This fallback skill keeps Tailwind work aligned with the conventions already present in this repository. Prefer extending the closest existing implementation over inventing a new abstraction, and verify neighboring states before finishing.

## Quick Start

### Inspect the current implementation

```sh
rg -n "tailwind|patterns|workflows" .
rg --files | rg "tailwind|patterns|workflows"
```

### Make the smallest compatible change

- Inspect nearby implementations before writing anything new.
- Prefer the smallest change that fits the repository's current structure and naming.
- Keep the output easy to review, easy to extend, and easy to verify.

### Verify before finishing

- Verify the changed path and the most likely adjacent edge cases.
- Check that naming, layering, and file placement still match nearby code.
- Confirm there is a clear reason for any new abstraction, dependency, or workflow.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Why it matters | What to check |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Existing patterns | Keeps the repo coherent | Start from the nearest matching implementation before editing |
| Scope control | Prevents abstraction creep | Keep the change in the same layer as surrounding code |
| Verification | Catches regressions early | Recheck adjacent states, edge cases, and integration points |
| References | Speeds up repeat work | Use the linked topic files when the task needs deeper guidance |

## Common Patterns

### Patterns

**When:** The task touches patterns in Tailwind work.

- Inspect the nearest existing implementation before introducing a new pattern.
- Reuse naming, file placement, and helper utilities that are already established in this repo.
- Keep the change easy to review and easy to extend without widening scope unnecessarily.

### Workflows

**When:** The task touches workflows in Tailwind work.

- Inspect the nearest existing implementation before introducing a new pattern.
- Reuse naming, file placement, and helper utilities that are already established in this repo.
- Keep the change easy to review and easy to extend without widening scope unnecessarily.
